<h1>My Final Project Plan </h1>
<body>
    <h3>Short description of what im going to do:</h3>
    <p> What I plan on doing is a mood-based music selector. This will be a frontend website where you (the user) will be given a few options to choose from—*happy, sad, excited/hype,* and *chill*. Once one of the moods is clicked, the site will generate a song or a list of songs that fit the vibe of that mood. The idea is to make something that feels fun, simple to use, and personal depending on how you’re feeling in the moment. </p> <p> Each mood selection will look and feel different, with matching background colors, icons, and maybe some subtle animations to help set the tone. For example, the “chill” option might have soft tones and a calm layout, while “hype” would have something more bold and energetic. I want the whole experience to be more than just functional—I want it to feel immersive and reflective of the mood the user picks. Songs will be embedded using the Spotify API or a similar tool, depending on what works best. I still need to do more research on what options are out there. </p> <p> For building it, I’ll mainly use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’d like to try using Node.js for some backend features, but that depends on time. </p>

<h3>Figma sketches and design ideas</h3>
<p>Rather then doing figma sketches I decided to just start working on the base/outline of the website</p>
