        <strong>MoodVibes</strong> was created to help people connect with music that fits their feelings. Whether you're celebrating or seeking comfort, the right song can elevate your mood. One of my favorite things to do with friends is share playlists. We’re constantly sending each other links, diving into each other’s favorite tracks, and discovering artists or songs we might’ve never found on our own.

        This site uses curated Spotify playlists which you can click on easily to save that playlist or tack to your personal spotify account and instantly match your vibe. Click a mood and start listening!
