    <h1>My Story</h1>
    <section>
      <p>
        I was born in India and left when I was about 10 years old, 
        Im from the punjab region which you can learn more about <a href="Assignment1/page2.html">here</a> 
      </p>

      <p>
        My parents and my sister and I moved to Washington out of all places and I guess my parents decided they liked it cause we never moved again...
      </p>

      <p>
        I learned english pretty quick and was filling out my parents paperwork at the ripe old age of 13, if you are a child of immigrant parents I feel like you can relate to this.
      </p>

      <p>
        I played soccer throughout my childhood and would travel around washington playing different teams but after a couple of years of doing decided I didn't like chasing a ball back and fourth so I focused on school.
      </p>

      <p>
        I eventually graduated high school and ended up here at western and realized my second year here that I wanted to go into computer science.
      </p>

      <p>
        Absolutely love it here but I do miss simpler times in India sometimes but luckily im fly home my parents every year or so.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of my my recent trips back home been the best as I,ve been able to explore more of the country and experience things I never did even when I lived there. 
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the recent visits we went to rajasthan and went to dessert and was able to do thins like sand boarding, riding camels and paragliding over sand dunes. Here are some of those <a href="Assignment1/page3.html">Photos</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        During that trip we also visited the Golden Temple in Amritsarâ€”a place that holds deep spiritual and cultural meaning and celebrate one of my favorite holidays Holi in india as <a href="Assignment1/page4.html">well</a>
