    <h3>24 Hour Without Phone Reflection</h3>
    <p>
        Over the weekend, I tried spending the day without my phone. To make it a little easier for myself, I chose a day where I knew I would be busy and could keep myself entertained. So, this Saturday, I woke up and did NOT immediately check my phone and lay in bed for an hour. I was able to get up immediately and get ready. This same pattern translated throughout the day, where I was just less distracted and was able to finish tasks a lot more quickly. Around the house, leaving my phone was fine because I was able to distract myself with homework, finish tasks around the house that I had been putting off, and even made time for reading a physical book, which I never tend to do anymore. When I left the house, however, not having a phone became more of a problem. The day prior, I had let my friends know that I was going to be on my phone less/not at all, so they should expect fewer/none texts from me, but that was difficult because we were supposed to meet up for coffee, but we needed to plan a time and decide on the coffee shop. Another time I felt the need to look at my phone was for directions. I guess I never realized how much I tend to rely on my phone to tell me where to go. Something else I noticed was how much I rely on my phone in awkward social settings. As just waiting in line for something, I kept fidgeting and was itching to grab my phone to make the time go by faster. Overall, I actually enjoyed not being on my phone as much because I do think I spend too much time on it regularly. Not being on my phone in the mornings and just less in general when I'm home is definitely something I want to try implementing moving forward, but out in public and in social settings, I will keep using my phone just the same.
