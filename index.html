        I was born in India and didn't leave until I was about 10 years old, Although my parents loved India, a lot of family had already moved to the the United States and they wanted to do the same. Although Ive had a great time here I cant help but miss it at times.
        I miss the food, the culture, and the people. I miss the festivals and the celebrations. 
        I don't have to miss it for long though because im able to take trips back home whenever I have time!
